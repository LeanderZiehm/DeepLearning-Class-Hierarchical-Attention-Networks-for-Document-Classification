[{"title":"Europe rights watchdog says Turkey's emergency laws go too far","text":"BRUSSELS (Reuters) - A leading European rights watchdog called on Turkey on Friday to ease post-coup state of emergency laws that have seen thousands arrested and restore power to regional authorities. President Tayyip Erdogan has overseen a mass purge in the armed forces and the judiciary, as well as a crackdown on critics including academics and journalists since a failed military coup in July last year.  An advisory body to the Council of Europe, of which Turkey is a member, acknowledged in a report  the need for certain extraordinary steps taken by Turkish authorities to face a dangerous armed conspiracy .  However...Turkish authorities have interpreted these extraordinary powers too extensively,  said the experts, known as the Venice Commission, in an opinion that has no legal force. It urged Ankara to lift laws allowing it to pick mayors, deputy mayors and members of local councils outside of local elections, a reference to rules the Turkish government has used to replace local pro-Kurdish politicians across the largely Kurdish southeast of the country. The experts at the Council of Europe, Europe s leading human rights organization with 47 member states, recommended Turkey set a time limit on the emergency rules and ensure proper judicial oversight of any counter-terrorism measures. Erdogan has accused U.S.-based, Islamic cleric Fethullah Gulen of orchestrating the coup, in which 250 people were killed. Gulen has denied involvement.  Since then, more than 50,000 people have been jailed pending trial over links to Gulen, while 150,000 people have been sacked or suspended from jobs in the public and private sectors. Rights groups and Turkey s Western allies - including the European Union - have been taken aback by the scale of the purge, sounding alarm that Erdogan was using the coup as a pretext to quash dissent. The government in Turkey, a NATO member, says it must neutralize the threat represented by Gulen s network deeply rooted in the army, schools and courts.

The move was part of a policy change initiated by then-President Barack Obama in 2011 to pull back from deporting immigrants who had formed deep ties in the United States and whom the government considered no threat to public safety. Instead, the administration would prioritize illegal immigrants who had committed serious crimes.  Last month, things changed again for the painter, who has lived in the United States illegally since 2005 and has a U.S.-born child. He received news that the government wanted to put his deportation case back on the court calendar, citing another shift in priorities, this time by President Donald Trump.  The Trump administration has moved to reopen the cases of hundreds of illegal immigrants who, like Velasquez, had been given a reprieve from deportation, according to government data and court documents reviewed by Reuters and interviews with immigration lawyers.  Trump signaled in January that he planned to dramatically widen the net of illegal immigrants targeted for deportation, but his administration has not publicized its efforts to reopen immigration cases.  It represents one of the first concrete examples of the crackdown promised by Trump and is likely to stir fears among tens of thousands of illegal immigrants who thought they were safe from deportation.  While cases were reopened during the Obama administration as well, it was generally only if an immigrant had committed a serious crime, immigration attorneys say. The Trump administration has sharply increased the number of cases it is asking the courts to reopen, and its targets appear to include at least some people who have not committed any crimes since their cases were closed.  Between March 1 and May 31, prosecutors moved to reopen 1,329 cases, according to a Reuters' analysis of data from the Executive Office of Immigration Review, or EOIR. The Obama administration filed 430 similar motions during the same period in 2016.\u00a0  Jennifer Elzea, a spokeswoman for U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, confirmed the agency was now filing motions with immigration courts to reopen cases where illegal immigrants had \u201csince been arrested for or convicted of a crime.\u201d  It is not possible to tell from the EOIR data how many of the cases the Trump administration is seeking to reopen involve immigrants who committed crimes after their cases were closed.  Attorneys interviewed by Reuters say indeed some of the cases being reopened are because immigrants were arrested for serious crimes, but they are also seeing cases involving people who haven\u2019t committed crimes or who were cited for minor violations, like traffic tickets.  \u201cThis is a sea change, said attorney David Leopold, former president of the American Immigration Lawyers Association. \u201cBefore, if someone did something after the case was closed out that showed that person was a threat, then it would be reopened. Now they are opening cases just because they want to deport people.\u201d  Elzea said the agency reviews cases, \u201cto see if the basis for prosecutorial discretion is still appropriate.\u201d  After Obama announced his shift toward targeting illegal immigrants who had committed serious crimes, prosecutors embraced their new discretion to close cases.  Between January 2012 and Trump\u2019s inauguration on Jan. 20, the government shelved some 81,000 cases, according to Reuters\u2019 data analysis. These so-called \u201cadministrative closures\u201d did not extend full legal status to those whose cases were closed, but they did remove the threat of imminent deportation.  Trump signed an executive order overturning the Obama-era policy on Jan. 25. Under the new guidelines, while criminals remain the highest priority for deportation, anyone in the country illegally is a potential target.  In cases reviewed by Reuters, the administration explicitly cited Trump's executive order in 30 separate motions as a reason to put the immigrant back on the court docket. (For a link to an excerpted document: tmsnrt.rs\/2sI6aby)  Since immigration cases aren\u2019t generally public, Reuters was able to review only cases made available by attorneys.  In the 32 reopened cases examined by Reuters:  \u201422 involved immigrants who, according to their attorneys, had not been in trouble with the law since their cases were closed.  \u2014Two of the cases involved serious crimes committed after their cases were closed: domestic violence and driving under the influence.  \u2014At least six of the cases involved minor infractions, including speeding after having unpaid traffic tickets, or driving without a valid license, according to the attorneys.  In Velasquez\u2019s case, for example, he was cited for driving without a license in Tennessee, where illegal immigrants cannot get licenses, he said.  \u201cI respect the law and just dedicate myself to my work,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t understand why this is happening.\u201d  Motions to reopen closed cases have been filed in 32 states, with the highest numbers in California, Florida and Virginia, according to Reuters\u2019 review of EOIR data. The bulk of the examples reviewed by Reuters were two dozen motions sent over the span of a couple days by the New Orleans ICE office.  Sally Joyner, an immigration attorney in Memphis, Tennessee said one of her Central American clients, who crossed the border with her children in 2013, was allowed to stay in the United States after the government filed a motion to close her case in December 2015.  Since crossing the border, the woman has not been arrested or had trouble with law enforcement, said Joyner, who asked that her client\u2019s name not be used because of the pending legal action.  Nevertheless, on March 29, ICE filed a two-page motion to reopen the case against the woman and her children. When Joyner queried ICE, an official said the agency had been notified that her client had a criminal history in El Salvador, according to documents seen by Reuters.  The woman had been arrested for selling pumpkin seeds as an unauthorized street vendor. Government documents show U.S. authorities knew about the arrest before her case was closed.  Dana Marks, president of the National Association of Immigration Judges, said that revisiting previously closed matters will add to a record backlog of 580,000 pending immigration cases.  \u201cIf we have to go back and review all of those decisions that were already made, it clearly generates more work,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s a judicial do-over.\u201d  ","subject":"politicsNews","date":"June 9, 2017 "},{"title":"At G20 summit, Trump pledges $639 million in aid to four countries","text":"HAMBURG (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump on Saturday promised $639 million in aid to feed people left starving because of drought and conflict in Somalia, South Sudan, Nigeria and Yemen. Trump\u2019s pledge came during a working session of the G20 summit of world leaders in Hamburg, providing a \u201cgodsend\u201d to the United Nations\u2019 World Food Programme, the group\u2019s executive director, David Beasley, told Reuters on the sidelines of the meeting. \u201cWe\u2019re facing the worst humanitarian crisis since World War Two,\u201d said Beasley, a Republican and former South Carolina governor who was nominated by Trump to head the U.N. agency fighting hunger worldwide. The new funding brings to over $1.8 billion aid promised by the United States for fiscal year 2017 for the crises in the four countries, where the United Nations has estimated more than 30 million people need urgent food assistance. \u201cWith this new assistance, the United States is providing additional emergency food and nutrition assistance, life-saving medical care, improved sanitation, emergency shelter and protection for those who have been affected by conflict,\u201d USAID said in a statement. Rob Jenkins, acting head of the USAID\u2019s bureau of democracy, conflict and humanitarian assistance, said of the funding, over $191 million would go to Yemen, $199 million to South Sudan, $121 million to Nigeria and almost $126 million for Somalia. Conflict in all four countries had made it difficult to reach some communities in need of food, he noted. \u201cWe\u2019re in a dire situation right now,\u201d said Jenkins, adding that USAID was also concerned with the situation in southern Ethiopia. \u201cThe situation in southern Ethiopia fortunately does not rise to the dire situation of the other four, but the situation is deteriorating and might very well be catastrophic without additional interventions,\u201d he said, adding that Washington had already provided some $252 million this year to Ethiopia, \u201cbut the needs continue to grow.\u201d Beasley said the U.S. funding was about a third of what the WFP estimated was required this year to deal with urgent food needs in the four countries in crisis as well as in other areas. The WFP estimates that 109 million people around the world will need food assistance this year, up from 80 million last year, with 10 of the 13 worst-affected zones stemming from wars and \u201cman-made\u201d crises, Beasley said. \u201cWe estimated that if we didn\u2019t receive the funding we needed immediately that 400,000 to 600,000 children would be dying in the next four months,\u201d he said. Trump\u2019s announcement came after his administration proposed sharp cuts in funding for the U.S. State Department and other humanitarian missions as part of his \u201cAmerica First\u201d policy. Beasley said the agency had worked hard with the White House and the U.S. government to secure the funding, but Trump would insist that other countries contributed more as well. A WFP spokesman said Germany recently pledged an additional 200 million euros for food relief.

The decision late Wednesday by U.S. District Judge Susan Wigenton clears the way for the two defendants to be sentenced on March 15. Bridget Kelly, a former deputy chief of staff under the Republican governor, and Bill Baroni, the former deputy executive director of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, were convicted in November of orchestrating the shutdown of access lanes at the George Washington Bridge in September 2013. U.S. prosecutors said the resulting gridlock in Fort Lee, New Jersey, was intended to punish the town\u2019s Democratic mayor for declining to back Christie\u2019s re-election campaign. Christie has not been charged in the case and has denied any knowledge of the plan. But Kelly and another conspirator, former Port Authority official David Wildstein, both testified that Christie was aware of the lane closures before they occurred. Wildstein pleaded guilty and appeared at trial as the government\u2019s star witness. In asking for an acquittal or a new trial, Kelly\u2019s lawyers had argued that Wigenton erred when she instructed jurors that they could convict the defendants even if prosecutors failed to prove they had intentionally targeted the mayor for retribution. The motivation for the scheme, Kelly\u2019s lawyers said, was at the core of the government\u2019s case. But Wigenton said motive, while central to the prosecution, is not a required element of the crimes for which Baroni and Kelly were convicted. \u201cThe government was under no obligation to introduce evidence of motive, although motive helps present a coherent narrative of events to a jury,\u201d she wrote. Lawyers for Baroni and Kelly did not immediately respond to requests for comment. They can still ask a U.S. appeals court to overturn the verdict after sentencing has taken place. A spokesman for New Jersey\u2019s chief federal prosecutor, U.S. Attorney Paul Fishman, declined to comment on the ruling. The scandal\u2019s fallout helped sink Christie\u2019s once-promising political career. He was passed over for a position in President Donald Trump\u2019s administration after his own presidential bid sputtered, and he has seen record-low approval ratings in New Jersey.

(Reuters) - If Democratic hopeful Bernie Sanders has a chance of drawing African-American voters away from rival Hillary Clinton in South Carolina\u2019s presidential nominating contest on Feb. 27, his best opportunity will be among the young. African Americans support former Secretary of State Clinton by more than a 3-to-1 margin nationwide, but among young blacks 18 to 29 years old, that margin shrinks to 46 percent for Clinton versus 33 percent for Sanders, according to recent Reuters\/Ipsos polling. African Americans overwhelmingly back Democrats, but opinion polls in the run-up to the Nov. 8 presidential election show younger blacks more apt to reject an establishment candidate. They seem less inclined than their parents to reward Clinton for the outreach of her husband, former President Bill Clinton, and more drawn to Sanders\u2019 outspoken views on reducing income inequality, cracking down on Wall Street, and cutting the cost of college. Reuters\/Ipsos polling last year showed that 36 percent of blacks between 18 and 29 years old thought the country was on the \u201cwrong track,\u201d compared with 23 percent of blacks who were at least 60 years old. For Sanders, a U.S. senator from Vermont who describes himself as a democratic socialist, this trend could help him chip away at Clinton\u2019s firewall of minority voters in the southern states, after his strong showings against her - especially among the young - in the early Democratic Party contests of Iowa and New Hampshire, both more than 90 percent white. The voting-age population in South Carolina, one of the next stops on the primary trail, is about 67 percent white and 27 percent black, the U.S. Census Bureau says. In Orangeburg, South Carolina, students\u00a0at the historically black schools of South Carolina State University and Claflin University appeared split this week over which of the two candidates to support. Students praised Clinton\u2019s work on behalf of women and minorities and her years of Washington experience. But many said they also were intrigued by Sanders\u2019 plans to raise taxes on wealthier people and Wall Street firms, provide universal healthcare and offer free public college tuition. \u201cThe history is important. But at the same time ... you still need a plan,\u201d said Travis Pascoe, 25, a second-year graduate student at Claflin. He said Sanders\u2019 plans for reducing inequality by taxing the wealthy and expanding Medicare to cover all Americans should resonate with the black community. \u201cI think that would help the black community because we\u2019re the least privileged,\u201d he said.  Eight of 16 students interviewed were undecided voters. Of the eight students whose minds were made up, four students said they planned to vote for Clinton.  Ethel Hillman, 25, a freshman who served in the military before going to college for social work, said she and many of her fellow students were voting for Clinton. She described Sanders as too aloof. \u201cHe\u2019s not socially connected, I would say, to the black community,\u201d she said. \u201cHe cares from a distance.\u201d South Carolina State\u2019s student center, which houses a bowling center and dining area, has quotes on walls from prominent black leaders, including President Barack Obama and first lady Michelle Obama, singer Michael Jackson and educator Booker T. Washington.  On one wall is a memorial to students killed in the 1968 \u201cOrangeburg massacre,\u201d when protesters were shot by state highway patrol officers on campus amid tensions over racial discrimination. For Sanders, minority voters have been a lingering weakness. He struggled early in his campaign to appeal to black voters. Protesters from the Black Lives Matter movement interrupted his speeches, viewing him as out of touch with black issues. To counter that perception, Sanders touted his college civil rights activism, did publicity events with rapper Killer Mike, and on Wednesday met black civil rights leader Al Sharpton in Harlem. Like Clinton, Sanders has sent surrogates to historically black colleges. The writer and activist Cornel West spoke at South Carolina State on Sanders\u2019 behalf, and actress Angela Bassett spoke there in support of Clinton.      Where Sanders is fighting for inroads into the black electorate, Clinton finds a comfort zone. Her campaign has said it believes its road to the nomination would become smoother once it moves south, to places where she and her husband, the former president, have ties to minority leaders. Clinton picked up the endorsement of the Congressional Black Caucus political action committee on Thursday. As the stakes mount in South Carolina, Representative Jim Clyburn, one of the state\u2019s most influential Democrats, said he was considering endorsing a candidate. He did not endorse in Hillary Clinton\u2019s 2008 primary race against Obama, and previously said he would not weigh in this year. His wavering was echoed in the views of several students on the campus of South Carolina State. \u201cI\u2019m kind of caught between Bernie Sanders and Hillary,\u201d said Kelsie Bryant, 19, a sophomore education major at South Carolina State. She said it was important to have a woman president, and she was worried Sanders was too old. But she said his meeting with Sharpton sent a positive signal about his outreach to blacks. Cetris Brooks, 21, a senior biology major at South Carolina State, said that ultimately she was \u201ca little bit more trusting\u201d of Clinton because of what the former first lady meant to her family. She said her parents had long supported Clinton, and her uncle knew the former president.

Schneiderman\u2019s office said it has identified \u201cmultiple constitutional defects\u201d with the Republican healthcare bills. The U.S. Senate is considering legislation to repeal parts of the Affordable Care Act, Democratic former President Barack Obama\u2019s signature legislative achievement, commonly known as Obamacare. However, eight to 10 Republican U.S. senators have serious concerns about the proposals, moderate Republican Senator Susan Collins, who opposes the bill, said on Sunday. Democratic state attorneys general have become a major source of opposition to Republican President Donald Trump\u2019s policies, having successfully forced him to significantly scale back a ban on travel from six Muslim-majority countries. A group of Democrats led by Schneiderman and California Attorney General Xavier Becerra earlier this year sought to intervene in a pending lawsuit in order to defend subsidies paid to health insurers under Obamacare. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit has not yet ruled on that request.  Among the Republican proposals that raise constitutional issues are one that would defund the Planned Parenthood health group for a year, and another that would shift some Medicaid costs in New York from counties to the state, known as the Collins-Faso amendment, said Amy Spitalnick, a Schneiderman spokeswoman. Critics of the latter provision say it would drastically increase costs in the state budget for the Medicaid healthcare program for the poor and disabled.

Setya Novanto was arrested last month over his suspected role in the scandal linked to a national electronic identity card scheme. Anti-corruption investigators then took him into custody from where he sent a letter to assembly leaders pleading to be allowed to keep his job while he fought the charges.  Mr Novanto has resigned,  member of parliament Yandri Susanto told Reuters, referring to a letter in which Novanto announced his decision.  He didn t say why.  A replacement for him as speaker was expected to be decided by his party, Golkar, at an extraordinary meeting on Dec. 19, said Dito Ganinduto, a member of parliament from Novanto s Golkar party. Novanto had not resigned as chairman of Golkar, Ganinduto said. A lawyer for Novanto, Maqdir Ismail, deferred questions on the matter to acting Golkar chairman Idrus Marham. Marham could not be reached for comment. Novanto had clung to power through several previous corruption cases. His latest battle with the graft agency has gripped Indonesia, where newspapers have splashed the story on front pages and social media posts mocking him have been widely shared.  Before his detention last month he had for months declined to answer summonses for questioning by the Corruption Eradication Commission, known by its Indonesian initials KPK. The allegations against Novanto have reinforced the perception among Indonesians that their parliament, long regarded as riddled with entrenched corruption, is a failing institution. Indonesia was ranked last year at 90 out of 176 countries on Transparency International s corruption perception index. The watchdog has singled out parliament as Indonesia s most corrupt institution, and in July called on President Joko Widodo to protect the KPK against attempts by the legislature to weaken the commission s powers. Critics inside and outside the parliament say the root problem is money politics.
